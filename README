A collection (just 1 to start with) of MaxMSP patches, mostly just small snippets and not full projects.

Binaural.pat
  A patcher to demonstrate "Binaural Beats", the phenomenom of a pulsation experienced when each ear listens to two Sin waves that differ slightly in pitch
  I've added in some defaults, the most interesting of which are the 444 and 222; obviously being half the frequency means an octive lower but it would also demonstrate twice the Binaural Frequency
